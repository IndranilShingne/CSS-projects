                    Kashmir is located on the Jhelum River in north India. It is always cold here. It is
                    very beautiful. It is called Paradise on Earth. Its beauty seems very captivating in every season.
                    In summer
                    there is greenery everywhere and in winter everything is covered with snow. The red apples hanging
                    on the
                    apples look very beautiful. There are many tourist places to see in Kashmir like Gulmarg, Sonmarg
                    etc.
                    Gulmarg is called the life of Kashmir. Sarovars like Vullar add to the beauty of Kashmir.
                    The people of Kashmir are called Kashmiri Pandits and they are very beautiful. They are also
                    non-vegetarians
                    and consume kebabs etc. After eating here, it is rotated in sweets. Saffron is cultivated here.
                    Whoever goes
                    to this place makes sure to buy show pieces made of walnut wood, apple, Pashmina shawl and saffron.
                    Kashmir
                    is a matter of great dispute between India and Pakistan. Kashmir has its own flag and it has its own
                    constitution under Section 370 of the Constitution of India. No person outside Kashmir can buy land
                    in
                    Kashmir.</div>

                    headquarter. Kedarnath is the most remote of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. It is

                    Mathura, being the birthplace of Lord Krishna, is one of the important Hindu pilgrimage sites. Every
                    inch of Mathura is clothed in reverend devotion to Lord Krishna, the eternal lover of Radha, the
                    warrior, the diplomat and the hero of the cowherd colleagues. Mathura without Lord Krishna is like
                    Life without Water.

                    There is hardly any need to mention that the city of Mathura (and the whole of Brajbhumi, for that
                    matter) is not an ordinary material city, for it is the transcendental abode of Lord Krishna and His
                    consorts and a Cosmic Place for His Divine ‘Leela’ sport.
                    You can go on counting the holy places in Mathura without ever coming to an end. This is easily
                    understandable in light of the fact that there is the legend of Lord Shri Krishna connected to
                    virtually every nook and corner of the city. For instance, the ‘Vishram Ghat’ on the Yamuna
                    Waterfront is said to be the holy place where Krishna is supposed to have rested after killing his
                    tyrannical and evil uncle - King Kamsa.

                    From the moment Krishna was born up till the time He grew into a valiant youth, the bigger part of
                    his time was spent in Brajbhumi, mainly constituting Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul, Nandgaon, Govardhan
                    and Barsana.</div>

                    Jaipur is considered to be the capital of Rajasthan. It is famous across the country for its rich
                    tradition and diverse culture. The variety of forts and palaces showcase the exciting history of
                    Jaipur. This city was formed by the Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II know as a great warrior in the
                    ancient times.

                    Although initially the capital of Rajasthan used to be Amber but considering the safety viewpoint,
                    the capitals were changed later on. Since several construction and architecture were painted with
                    the colour terracotta pink back in the earlier times, the name of the city popularly became the pink
                    city.

                    This city has been trendy amongst the visitors since earlier times, due to the availability of
                    several famous hotels. One of which is the Raj Vilas which is known widely due to its beautiful
                    architecture. These palaces in ancient times belonged to the kings and their families. Therefore,
                    all of these hotels have a bit of royalty in them.

                    descends through two successive falls set in dells of fern-covered rocks.Elephant Falls is situated
                    at the outskirts of the main city of Shillong in the East Khasi Hills District, Upper Shillong. It
                    is almost 12 km away from the Shillong city center.A small signboard quite near the Shillong Peak,
                    marks a small road that turns off to the edge of the mountain. This road leads to the falls.

                    From the gate, there is a steep, slippery flight of stairs to navigate each level of the fall with
                    the first and second level facilitated with benches to rest and relax.

                    A ticket costing 20 INR is required to view the fall with an additional charge of 20 INR for

                    The Golden Pagoda of Namsai, also known as Kongmu Kham, in the Tai-Khamti language, is a
                    Burmese-style Buddhist temple that was opened in 2010. It is located on a 20 hectares (49 acres)
                    complex in Namsai District of Arunachal Pradesh, India and at a distance of 68 km (42 mi) from the
                    nearest railway station Tinsukia, Assam. A sum of 3 crore was spent by Arunachal politician Chowna
                    Mein, who was the local MLA in building the pagoda in a plot provided by the state government. The
                    World Tripiṭaka Foundation is currently developing Kongmu Kham as the first international Tripiṭaka

                    The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building on the Maidan in Central Kolkata, built between
                    1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria, Empress of India from 1876 to 1901.
                    The largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the world, it stands in 64 acres of gardens and is now
                    a museum under the control of the Ministry of Culture.Following the death of Queen Victoria in
                    January 1901,[3] Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, suggested that a fitting memorial to the late
                    Queen-Empress should be created in Calcutta, now called Kolkata, then the capital of British India.
                    He proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.[4] Curzon said,
                    "Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every
                    newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will
                    flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history and see revived before their eyes the
                    marvels of the past."
                    The government officials, princes, politicians, and people of India responded generously to Lord
                    Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to one
                    crore, five lakhs of Rupees (₹), was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions.
                    The site chosen was near the present-day Raj Bhavan, known at the time as Government House. The
                    construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905, with a
                    subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project. There was also some uncertainty about the
                    strength of the foundations, and tests on them were carried out.[7] On 4 January 1906, the new
                    Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone.
                    The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta, and work on the
                    superstructure began in 1910.
                    In 1912, before construction was finished, King George V announced the transfer of the capital of
                    India from Calcutta to New Delhi.[9] Thus, the Victoria Memorial came to stand in what would be a
                    major provincial city, rather than a capital.
                    The Victoria Memorial was completed and formally opened to the public in 1921.[7][8]
                    After 1947, some additions were made to the Memorial.
                    A smaller Victoria memorial was also constructed in the Hardoi District, which has since been
                    converted into a city club for recreation. Mahatma Gandhi addressed meetings at Hardoi in the 1930s.

                    Lonar Lake, also known as Lonar crater, is a notified National Geo-heritage Monument,[2][3][4]
                    saline, soda lake, located at Lonar in Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India. Lonar Lake is an
                    astrobleme created by a meteorite impact during the Pleistocene Epoch.[5][6] It is one of only four
                    known hyper-velocity impact craters in basaltic rock anywhere on Earth. The other three basaltic
                    impact structures are in southern Brazil.[7] Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of 1.2 kilometres (3,900
                    ft) and is about 137 metres (449 ft) below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8
                    kilometres (5,900 ft) in diameter.[8]

                    Lonar Crater sits inside the Deccan Plateau – a massive plain of volcanic basalt rock created by
                    eruptions some 65 million years ago. Its location in this basalt field suggested to some geologists
                    that it was a volcanic crater. Today, however, Lonar Crater is understood to be the result of a
                    meteorite impact.[9] The water in the lake is both saline and alkaline.

                    Geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, naturalists and astronomers have published studies on
                    various aspects of the ecosystem of this crater lake.[10]

                    Although the crater's age was previously estimated to be 52,000 ± 6,000 years,[11] newer studies
                    suggest an age of 576,000 ± 47,000 years.[12][13]

                    The Smithsonian Institution, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Survey of India, the
                    University of Sagar and the Physical Research Laboratory have conducted extensive studies of the
                    site.[14][15] Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered in this lake in 2007.[16]

                    A 2019 study, conducted by IIT Bombay found that the minerals in the lake soil are very similar to
                    the minerals found in moon rocks brought back during the Apollo Program.[17] The lake was declared a
                    protected Ramsar site in November 2020.</div>
